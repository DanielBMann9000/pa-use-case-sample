Change Log
==========

1.2.1 - Release Date:
-----------------------------------------------
### Changes:

* Updated the EULA

1.2 - Release Date: December 2013
-----------------------------------------------

### Enhancements:

* Xamarin Android and iOS are now supported platforms.
* Logger implementations for Windows Phone, Classic.NET, and Windows Store can now accept a filename for the log file to use.
* Automatic Session Extension was added to all platforms, but only enabled by default for Xamarin Android

### Fixes:

* An invalid GUID for ApplicationID or CompanyID will no longer result in an exception being thrown.
* The reported Agent Version is now correct. 
* When Isolated Storage can not be initialized with User Scope, it will now fallback to Machine Scope. This affected some configurations of ASP.Net/IIS.
* If the Offline Storage implementation of the API fails for any reason, the API will continue to work without Offline Storage.
* When OmitPII is set, username will now be uniquely generated, rather than a static "Unknown" being reported. 

1.1 - Release Date: July 2013
-----------------------------------------------

### Enhancements:

* Added "Classic" .NET support, including ASP.Net and desktop application support.
* Improved and reformatted User Guide to HTML format.
* Added client-side logging to enable easy troubleshooting.
* Added Time-To-Live properties to message batches, so that very old messages can expire and be discarded.
* Added max message batch size properties (defaulting to 4MB).
* Now has support for "Subordinate" mode; this enables using APIs in multiple languages(C#, C++, Java, etc) to trace a single session. 
* Synchronous Application Stops now include timeout functionality to prevent an instrumented application from being hung open. 
* Improved handling of large message batches and other scenarios that might throw an OutOfMemoryException.
* The PAClient class on most platforms now implements the IPlatformClient interface. This enables easier mocking of analytics in the automated tests of an instrumented application.


### Fixes:

* Properly strip characters which are impossible to escape in XML before sending a message batch.
* There is now verification of the endpoint URL at Application Start.
* Other minor bug fixes.
